#### 2. Unzip it, and check the add-on sources

Unzip the .zip file you downloaded.  
Then, check if there are add-on sources.

Add-on sources are located on the different places depending on the add-on version.

|Version|Sources|
|---|---|
|6.0 - 6.3|src/magic_uv|
|4.0 - 5.2|uv_magic_uv|
|2.2 - 3.2|uv_copy_and_paste_uv|
|1.0 - 2.2|uv_copy_and_paste_uv.py|


#### 3. Copy add-on sources into your add-on folder

Location of add-on folder depends on your operating system.

|OS|Location|
|---|---|
|Windows|`C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Blender Foundation\Blender\<blender_version>\scripts\addons`|
|Mac|`/Users/<username>/Library/Application Support/Blender/<blender_version>/scripts/addons`|
|Linux|`/home/<username>/.config/blender/<blender_version>/scripts/addons`|

If you use Blender which version is >= 2.79, you must remove released Magic UV add-on from Blender official add-ons directory.
Then, copy add-on sources into Blender official add-ons directory.

Be careful that this add-on has different name depending on the version.
